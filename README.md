A very simple website to do term registration of a particular university using Node.js.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install MySQL server. For this, I recommend you to install [XAMPP] (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). After that, import database using `registration.sql`.
3. Since you are going to use it for the first time, some modules need to be installed. Type `npm install` after opening `ShortCommand.bat`.
4. Again type `node app`.
5. Now, go http://localhost:3000/loginform/ through your browser. Use 8115192 as ID, and Password.
